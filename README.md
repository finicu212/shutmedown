# shutmedown

This is a Python Flask web SaaS app (shut down as a service). A big red button that shuts down the server. Runs on port 8000 by default but you can change in config.cfg. Pressing the red button will also deduct 1$ from your bank account (jk)

I use this to shut down my PC from my bed because i'm lazy. my pc is hosting TV series which I pirated because fuck netflix

### Big Red Button

Here's an image with the button, in case your imagination is too small to imagine a big red button
